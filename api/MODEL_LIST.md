## Spectator Mode Candidates

For implementing spectator/ghost mode, consider these models:

1. **Empty_Cube** (`Characters/Empty_Cube.blockymodel`)
   - Simplest option: single 32x32x32 box
   - Can be made invisible with transparent texture
   - Minimal rendering overhead

2. **Spectre_Void** (`NPC/Void/Spectre_Void/Models/Model.blockymodel`)
   - Already ghost-themed
   - May have transparency effects built in

3. **Wraith** (`NPC/Undead/Wraith/Models/Model.blockymodel`)
   - Ghost entity
   - Designed to look ethereal

4. **Custom approach**:
   - Create a model with `visible: false` on all nodes
   - Or use existing model with fully transparent texture
