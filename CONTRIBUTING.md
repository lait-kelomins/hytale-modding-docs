# Contributing to Hytale Modding Docs

Thanks for your interest in improving this documentation! This is a community-driven project and contributions are very welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues
- **Found an error?** Open an issue describing what's wrong
- **Something doesn't work?** Let us know what you tried and what happened
- **Missing documentation?** Suggest what should be added

### Improve Documentation
- Fix typos, clarify confusing sections, or add examples
- Document new API discoveries you've made
- Add "How To" guides for common tasks

### Share Better Approaches
The patterns documented here are what we've found to work - not necessarily the best way. If you discover:
- A cleaner approach that avoids reflection
- A more efficient pattern
- An official API we missed

Please share it! Open an issue or PR.

## How to Submit Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your edits
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Documentation Style

### Code Examples
- Include imports when showing new classes
- Add comments explaining non-obvious code
- Mark verified patterns with `(VERIFIED)` in headings
- Use realistic, copy-paste-ready examples

### Formatting
- Use headers (`##`, `###`) to organize content
- Use tables for reference data
- Use code blocks with language hints (` ```java `)
- Add notes/warnings with blockquotes (`> **Note:**`)

### Terminology
- **Direct access** - Using types without reflection
- **Reflection required** - Must use `Class.forName()` or `.getMethod()`
- **VERIFIED** - Tested and confirmed working
- **UNTESTED** - Theoretical, needs validation

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority
- Corrections to incorrect information
- Patterns that avoid unnecessary reflection
- Entity spawn/despawn detection methods
- Interaction system improvements

### Nice to Have
- More "How To" guides
- Additional component documentation
- Asset file format documentation
- Performance tips
